Texture Baker inspired by [Image Sequence Blendshape Baker](http://www.creativegears.com.au/about/ "tool") written by [Michael Yates](http://www.creativegears.com.au/about/ "Michael Yates"). <br>
Update: Up on further search found [this](http://www.kielgnebba.com/script_bakeTextureSequence.html "tool") amazing tool. Which pretty much does what I wanted. <br> Search before developing any stuff. Lesson learned.
